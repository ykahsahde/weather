Suggestions for New Features or Improvements for Global Weather App

Problem: Limited Data Presentation

Users might want more detailed weather information beyond temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
Proposed Solution: Add more advanced weather parameters, such as UV index, visibility, air quality, and sunrise/sunset times. You could display these as optional data for users who want more detailed weather insights.

Alternatives Considered: Integrating weather forecasts for the upcoming days or visual weather maps.

Problem: No Location Auto-Detection

Users need to manually input their location every time they use the app.
Proposed Solution: Implement geolocation to automatically detect the user's location and provide the local weather information by default.

Alternatives Considered: Allow users to save their preferred locations for quick access later.

Problem: No Weather Forecast Feature

The app provides current weather conditions but lacks future weather forecasts.
Proposed Solution: Introduce a 7-day weather forecast option that users can toggle to see future weather predictions.

Alternatives Considered: A 3-day forecast for simplicity or integrating visual charts showing weather trends.

Problem: Static Background

The app's visual appearance remains the same regardless of weather conditions.
Proposed Solution: Add dynamic background themes that change based on the current weather (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy), enhancing the user experience.

Alternatives Considered: Allow users to customize the background theme manually.

Problem: Limited Customization Options

Users might prefer more customization, like setting their own default location or units of measurement (Celsius/Fahrenheit).
Proposed Solution: Add a settings page where users can save their preferences, such as default location, units (°C/°F), or enable/disable dark mode permanently.
